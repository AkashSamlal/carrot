## Getting Started

Making neurons

```javascript
let Node = require('@liquid-carrot/carrot').Node

let A = new Node() // neuron
let B = new Node() // neuron

A.connect(B)
A.activate(0.5)
console.log(B.activate())
```

Making neural networks

```javascript
let Network = require('@liquid-carrot/carrot').Network

let network = new Network([2, 2, 1]) // Builds a neural network with 5 neurons: 2 + 2 + 1
```

## Install

```bash
$ npm i @liquid-carrot/carrot
```
